# Outbox (telegram/outbox/)

The outbox is being built to replace the in-memory outbound queue
([`outbound-queue.md`](./outbound-queue.md)): outgoing Bot API calls become rows in PostgreSQL,
and any node sends them (the plan is epic
[#618](https://github.com/yuldashevsardor/telegram-bot/issues/618)). Nothing calls the directory
yet: so far it holds the payload codec alone.

## The payload rule

A row outlives the process that wrote it and is sent by whichever node claims it, so only what
another node can rebuild enters the outbox. `serialize(method, payload)`
(`payload-codec/payload-codec.ts`) takes only what it knows how to store and throws on anything
else, so no part of the payload reaches the row unchecked:

- strings, numbers, booleans, `null` and `undefined` pass to JSON, which writes an `undefined`
  field by leaving it out and a `NaN` as `null`, as when grammY sends the call itself. A `null`
  field stays in the row, although grammY leaves it out of a call it sends (`str()` in grammY's
  `core/payload.js`): it is left out when the row is sent. Arrays and plain objects are walked;
- a function becomes `undefined`, which JSON writes as it writes any `undefined` (a field left
  out, `null` in an array): `InlineQueryResultBuilder` returns plain objects that keep its builder
  methods (`.text()`, `.location()`) as fields (`inputMessageMethods()` in grammY's
  `convenience/inline_query.js`). A function as the whole payload throws `UnsupportedValue`: it
  would leave no payload at all;
- grammY's `InlineKeyboard` and `Keyboard` are walked as plain objects: they are classes with data
  fields only, which JSON writes as they are. Of the classes grammY exports, they are the only
  ones meant for a payload besides `InputFile`: `InputMediaBuilder` and `InlineQueryResultBuilder`
  build plain objects (`convenience/input_media.js`, `convenience/inline_query.js`);
- a `PathFile` (`new PathFile(path, filename?)`, `telegram/path-file/path-file.ts`, a subclass of
  `InputFile`) becomes the marker `{ "$pathFile": { "path", "filename" } }`; `deserialize()`
  rebuilds it as a `PathFile`. The marker is the stored format: a change of its key leaves the rows
  already written unreadable. A marker `serialize()` would not write is a corrupted row and throws
  `InvalidFileMarker` (the conditions are in `readMarker()`);
- any other `InputFile` throws `UnsupportedInputFile`: a `Buffer`, a stream or a supplier function
  lives only in the memory of this process. The check is by class, so a file grammY has already
  sent is rejected too, although grammY has replaced its `toJSON()` with one returning
  `attach://<id>` (`collectFiles()` in grammY's `core/payload.js`);
- an object that already carries the marker key throws `ReservedFileKey`: `deserialize()` would
  read it as a file;
- a string or a key that PostgreSQL does not accept in `jsonb` throws `UnstorableString`: U+0000
  or a lone UTF-16 surrogate (a caption cut through an emoji). The path and the file name of a
  `PathFile` are checked too;
- any other value throws `UnsupportedValue`: another class instance, a `Date`, an object without
  a prototype, a `bigint`, a symbol. A payload grammY builds holds none of them. A payload of
  plain objects that refers back to itself is not caught: the walk overflows the stack with a
  `RangeError`.

An error of `serialize()` names the method and where the value sits in the payload
(`media.1.thumbnail`), in the message and in `payload`.

grammY keeps the source of an `InputFile` private, so `PathFile` keeps the path in a public
field of its own. That is why a path passed to `new InputFile()` is rejected too: the codec cannot
read it.

The node that sends the row reads the file at the stored path. The rules this puts on the path are
in [`invariants.md`](./invariants.md), "The outbox".
